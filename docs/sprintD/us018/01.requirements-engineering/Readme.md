# US18: As a store manager i intend to analyse deals based on linear regression.

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a store manager, I intend to analyse the deals (only sale of houses and
apartments) made. In particular, I intend to compare property sale values with the
forecast values. The prediction of the value of the business/property must be
estimated based on the characteris

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The goal of this US is to forecast property sale prices (only for houses and
  apartments) using information from the property area (in square feet), the
  distance from the center (in miles), the number of bedrooms, the number of
  bathrooms and the number of parking spaces features of each property. In this
  study, simple linear and a multilinear regression models should be developed to
  find the linear relationship between: 1- each independent variable and the
  dependent variable; 2- all independent variables and the dependent variable. As
  the application is under development it is not possible to generate all data
  required for the analysis. Therefore, and to simulate a production system, we
  made available in moodle a CSV file (generated by the legacy system) containing
  information required for this study. The regression analysis should be
  documented in the application user manual (in the annexes) that must be
  delivered with the application. The report should include property values/prices
  (sale prices and forecast prices), the regression model used to estimate each
  value, R(SLR), R2 and R2 adjusted for SLR and MLR, confidence intervals and
  hypothesis tests for regression coefficients and significance model with Anova
* **AC2:** All houses and apartments business registered in the system should be used
  to fit the regression models.
* **AC3:** The system should enable the actor to select each regression model and
  should present the price estimates using the selected model. Moreover, the
  system should show the selected regression model and all required statistics.
* **AC4:** To implement this US the org.apache.commons.math4.stat package
  (https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/stat.html)
  should be used.
